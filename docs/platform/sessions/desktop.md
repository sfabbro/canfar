Desktop sessions on CANFAR provide a full Linux graphical environment directly in your browser, with access to CANFAR storage. Most astronomy software runs in dedicated containers on separate worker nodes and connects to your browser session using X11 protocols. This provides a familiar desktop experience for GUI applications and traditional workflows.

## 📋 Overview

Desktop sessions offer:

- **Full Linux desktop**: Accessed in your browser, with CANFAR storage integration
- **Multi-application workflow**: Run multiple programs and containers simultaneously
- **Traditional interfaces**: Use graphical astronomy software and desktop tools
- **File management**: Visual file browser and management tools
- **Session persistence**: Resume work exactly where you left off

### Common Use Cases

- **Running astronomy software in containers**: DS9, Aladin, TOPCAT, CASA, etc.
- **Multi-step workflows**: Combine several applications in sequence
- **Teaching and demonstrations**: Share desktop for educational purposes
- **Legacy software**: Applications requiring a desktop environment
- **Visual file management**: Organise data with graphical tools

**Storage Integration**: Direct access to CANFAR filesystems

## 🚀 Creating a Desktop Session

### Step 1: Select Session Type and Name

From the Science Portal dashboard, click the **plus sign (+)** to create a new session, then select **desktop** as your session type.

Choose a descriptive session name to help you identify it later:

**Good session names:**
- `data-reduction`
- `teaching-session`
- `multi-instrument-analysis`
- `collaborative-work`

### Step 2: Configure Resources

Desktop sessions use the default container and resource allocation. For most desktop work, the default settings are appropriate.

**Resource Guidelines:**
- **Memory**: 16GB is typically sufficient for most desktop workflows
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores handle most desktop applications well
- **Storage**: Use persistent storage in `/arc/` for important work

### Step 3: Launch Session

Click the **Launch** button and wait for your session to initialise:

Desktop sessions may take slightly longer to start than other session types as they need to set up the full graphical environment.

Your session will appear on the Science Portal dashboard.

!!! note "Connection Timing"
    Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the session link to work properly. If you see a "Bad gateway" error, wait a moment and try again.
