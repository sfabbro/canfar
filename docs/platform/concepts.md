## 🐳 Container Environments

Containers are the foundation of CANFAR's flexibility and reproducibility. They provide complete, portable software environments with all astronomy tools pre-configured and ready to use.

### Container Fundamentals

**What are Containers?**
:   Lightweight, portable packages that include an application and all its dependencies (libraries, tools, system settings) in a single, consistent environment.

**Why Containers for Astronomy?**
:   Solve the traditional "dependency hell" of astronomical software by packaging complex tool chains into reproducible, shareable environments.

### Traditional vs Container Workflows

=== "Traditional Software Installation"
    **Common Problems:**
    
    - Conflicting library versions and dependencies  
    - Missing system requirements and packages
    - Different behaviour across different machines
    - Time-consuming setup and configuration
    - Version compatibility issues between tools
    - "It works on my machine" syndrome

=== "Container Approach"
    **Solutions Provided:**
    
    - Consistent environment that works identically everywhere
    - All dependencies pre-installed and tested together
    - No installation or configuration required
    - Easy sharing and collaboration
    - Reproducible analysis results
    - Instant access to complex software stacks

### Popular CANFAR Containers

| Container | Purpose | Key Software | Best For |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **astroml** | General astronomy analysis | scipy, astropy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, pytorch, STILTS | Data analysis, visualization, ML, research |
| **improc** | Image processing | CASUTools, SExtractor, SWarp, IRAF, STILTS | Photometry, astrometry, source detection, PSF fitting |
| **casa** | Radio/MM astronomy | CASA software suite, Python | Radio astronomy, interferometry |
| **lsst** | LSST Analysis | LSST Software Stack | Image processing, LSST software stack and data access |
| **carta** | Data visualization | CARTA viewer, analysis tools | Interactive datacubes visualization |

!!! tip "Container Selection"
    **Start with `astroml`** for general astronomy work - it includes most common packages and is regularly updated with the latest astronomy and machine learning software.

### Container Lifecycle & Performance

**First Launch** (2-3 minutes)
:   kubernetes downloads the container image to node-local storage. This only happens once per container type.

**Subsequent Launches** (30-60 seconds)
:   Fast startup using cached images. Container starts with your storage systems already connected.

**During Session**
:   Full access to pre-configured software environment with your data mounted and ready to use.

**Session End**
:   Container is destroyed, scratch is wiped out, but all data in persistent storage remains safely preserved.

### Container Registry & Management

**Harbor Registry** (`images.canfar.net`)
:   Browse all available container images.

**Image Updates**
:   Containers should be regularly updated with latest software versions and security patches.

**Custom Containers**
:   Advanced users can build and maintain specialized containers for unique workflows or software requirements.

!!! success "Reproducible Science"
    Containers ensure your analysis runs identically for you, your collaborators, and future researchers. This is crucial for reproducible scientific workflows.

!!! tip "Advanced Usage"
    Use the **[CANFAR CLI](../cli/cli-help.md)** to list available containers, check versions, and manage sessions programmatically.


## ☸️ Sessions & Computing Resources

CANFAR uses Kubernetes to manage your computing sessions automatically. Sessions connect container environments with storage systems and provide different interfaces optimized for various workflows.

### Session Fundamentals

**Session Lifecycle**
:   Each session creates a fresh container instance that runs until you stop it or it times out. Your data persists independently in storage systems.

**Resource Management**
:   Kubernetes automatically handles resource allocation, scaling, and availability without requiring infrastructure knowledge.

**Data Persistence**
:   Container instances are temporary and destroyed at session end, but your files persist through the storage systems.
